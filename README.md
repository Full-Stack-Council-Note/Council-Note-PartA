### Target audience

### Tech stack

## Dataflow Diagram

When drawing up this dataflow diagram, I endeavoured to follow the conventions of dataflow diagrams, mainly Yourdon and Coad, along with my ideas and understanding of the app structure so far.

## User Stories

## Wireframes

I have drawn up the wireframes in this Miro board, to the best of my understanding of React Bootstrap so far, and how the app will piece together accordingly:

#### Trello Starting Coding

During the week of 17 Nov to 24 Nov 2024, I started some coding, at least trialling, of the frontend and backend to see how this MERN app will piece together and work, and to have some ideas for the Dataflow Diagram, Application Architecture Diagram and Wireframes.
